Latino Outdoors is a notable organization that advocates for Latinos to engage with nature and go camping. Latino Outdoors is a unique Latino-led organization that focuses on expanding and supporting the Latino community's access to the outdoors and nature. The organization's mission centers around fostering a national community of leaders in conservation and outdoor education, aiming to connect and engage Latino communities with the outdoors and nature for their wellbeing and to support their leadership in conservation efforts.

Latino Outdoors works on several fronts to achieve its mission. It organizes outdoor excursions for Latino families and communities, providing opportunities for experiences such as hiking, camping, and bird watching, among others, that they might not otherwise have. These activities are designed not only to enjoy and appreciate the natural world but also to instill a sense of environmental stewardship and conservation ethics among participants.

Moreover, Latino Outdoors places a strong emphasis on storytelling and sharing personal narratives about the Latino experience in the outdoors. This approach helps to highlight the diverse ways in which Latino communities engage with the outdoors and challenges stereotypical perceptions. Through storytelling, Latino Outdoors aims to inspire more Latinos to see themselves as part of the outdoor narrative.

Education and leadership development are also central to Latino Outdoors' efforts. By providing training and resources, the organization seeks to empower new leaders within the Latino community who can advocate for environmental conservation and increased access to outdoor activities. This leadership development is seen as key to sustaining long-term engagement with the outdoors and conservation efforts among Latino populations.

Overall, Latino Outdoors plays a critical role in advocating for greater access to the outdoors for Latinos, emphasizing the importance of nature for wellbeing, community building, and environmental stewardship. By doing so, it contributes to a more inclusive and diverse outdoor and conservation movement.
